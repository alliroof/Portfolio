            <h1>The Future of Moore's, Kryder's, and Robert's Laws</h1>

                <h4>Understanding Moore's, Kryder's, and Robert's Laws helps establish links between relevant signals in technology topics that appear unrelated–such as 5G Wireless Technology, the Internet of Things, and the surge of interest collecting retro games and comics–to help in forecasting possible futures. This article will explore examples of how these laws can predict future signals and inform forecasts for future technology.</h4>

        <h2>Future Signals</h2>
        <p>To forecast what the future of technology might bring, an understanding of the underlying principles of Gordon Moore's, Mark Kryder's, and Lawrence Robert's Laws is important; each Law helps explain factors which have contributed to rapid advances in technology over the past several decades. Moore's Law states processing power doubles every two years, which allows computers to become smaller and more powerful. Kryder's Law observes increasing amounts of data stored on more minute surfaces, which can make the technology more affordable. Finally, Robert's Law illustrates how data transmission speeds double every six to twenty-two months and helps explain the rate at which data speeds continue to increase.  These Laws help identify signals, which are clues that can be used to predict what new technologies might be possible in the future.</p>
        <p>As a first signal, take the example of 5G Wireless Technology. Demand for faster speeds and more reliability increases as consumers become more mobile. Moore's Law relates to Robert's Law in this scenario in that consumer devices have become smaller and, as a result, more mobile; consumers will demand faster wireless speeds, which will follow the principle of Robert's Law.</p>
        <p>Consider the Internet of Things (IoT) for a second signal. Despite IBM's incorrect prediction that the number of devices on the network would increase to over a trillion between 2012 and 2015, more devices have access today than ever before. In this scenario, Moore's Law can be used to illustrate that smaller, more powerful chips have contributed to the increased number of devices on the network. Also, Kryder's Law might be used to point to improved data storage as another factor contributing to the increase.</p>
        <p>To keep things interesting, imagine a signal that seems even further-reaching from technology when compared with to the first two: the increasing interest in video games, comic books, and graphic novels. The Game Preservation Society in Tokyo, Japan has made it a mission to preserve Japan's most classic video games. Further, a renewed interest in comics and graphic novels–among the female demographic, in particular–has led to a Renaissance, of sorts, as authors generate new content at a higher rate than ever before.</p>
        <h4>What could such old technologies and artifacts possibly have in common with the Laws of Moore, Kryder, and Roberts? For that answer, we'll have to look to the future.</h4>

        <h2>Forecast</h2>
        <p>5G Wireless Technology and the Internet of Things will redefine content aggregation and provide access to new types of data, making the data more accessible, more accurate, and more available than ever. Examples of firms in the content aggregation space include Netflix, Gamefly, Spotify, and Audible; these companies collect information, pay for the rights to redistribute that content, and then pass the information to consumers. The future market will see more centralization in the distribution of content. Today, the integration of Netflix into the Xfinity X1 platform developed by Comcast is an early example of centralization.</p>
        <p>5G Wireless Technology will continue to support Robert's law of increasing data transmission speeds, making it possible to transfer more significant quantities of data over a wireless connection. Today's consumers stream everything from movies to music on their phones but what if speed increases allowed for video game enthusiasts to stream their favorite video games, both modern and classic, straight to their mobile device, tablet, or television without the need of an emulator?</p>
        <p>Further, the Internet of Things doesn't just suggest more devices will connect to the network; the ways these technologies are used while on the network will change. As an example, today many devices come equipped with built-in applications for displaying external content, such as the PlayStation 4 and YouTube or a Smart TV and Netflix. What if a search on your Smart TV for "Captain America," "Batman," or "V for Vendetta" could return not just video and audio content but a digital collection of the comics themselves?</p>
        <p>In the proposed future, a consumer will have access to thousands of games and the ability to interact with other players online in real-time from any device. Efforts will need to be made to collect digital copies of comic books and graphic novels to store them in the cloud. A result of such efforts would be that collectors could no longer price casual readers out of enjoying older issues of their favorite series. In both examples, both modern and vintage content would be available to everyone in an instant.</p>
        <p>While many positive outcomes are probable, this future could come with some drawbacks. If large Multi-Service Operators (MSOs) like Comcast or Telecommunications firms such as AT&T can establish themselves as an ‘aggregator of aggregators,' the market could see decreasing competition, which often leads to higher prices for goods or services being passed on to consumers. Security is another concern. How would copyright laws be preserved and how confident could consumers feel their files were accurate reflections of the originals?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="subHead">
        <h2>Personal Foresight</h2>
        <p>As an enthusiast of video games and graphic novels alike, I am excited by the possibility that such a future could be made possible. I look forward to finding new ways of using our present technology to simplify the efforts necessary to preserve our video games as well as our comics and graphic novels. Despite the possibility that this future could bring with it some negative aspects, advances in technology are nothing to fear. As new developments emerge, I believe new security measures and regulations will be put in place to protect consumers at a pace similar to the release of such new technology.</p>
        <p>Whether this future forecast is one to look forward to or fear, it is safe to say that Moore's, Kryder's, and Robert's Laws will continue. As technology continues to advance, the parameters by which we measure these laws will evolve to suit the capability of the new technologies to which they are applied.</p>
