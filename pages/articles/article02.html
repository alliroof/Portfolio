            <h1>The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>
            <h3>Written July 6, 2018 by Alli Roof</h3>
            <div class="execSummary">
                <h4>When the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) launched in May of 2018, the European Union (EU) introduced new information security challenges. These challenges range from the increased staffing and technology costs associated with compliance to the imbalance of competition between large and small firms. Additionally, critics of the changes suggest the GDPR poses a threat to advancements in emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence. Despite the challenges, the GDPR is expected to offer opportunities, as well. By baking security into the design phase of the product lifecycle, some believe the regulation will promote innovation by enabling longer-term product and service lifecycles. The new requirements are complicated, but experts believe new jobs will be created to help organizations manage these changes and stay agile as the regulation evolves. Further, the EU being the first entity to implement formal legal controls around consumer data privacy and security, the rest of the world will have an opportunity to learn from the successes and failures of the GDPR.</h4>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This year, the European Union (EU) implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which puts formal legislation in place to regulate how companies obtain consent from consumers to collect their data, what they can use the information they collect for, and procedures for reporting a security breach (Giles 2018). Any firm possessing personal data belonging to a citizen of the EU must comply with the new regulation; the penalties for non-compliance could be severe, with maximum fines of up to €10 million Euros, or $12.4 million (Bloomberg 2018).</p>
        <p>The GDPR introduces many challenges. Between the complexity of the new regulations and increased spending on the technology needed to adhere to the new policy, some firms are struggling to adapt. Some companies have shut down operations as a result of the new regulations, and others have stopped operating in the EU entirely (Kottasová 2018). Additionally, some experts are concerned the new operating environment in the EU might stifle emerging technologies from taking off.</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, there are new opportunities, as well. The increased regulations and need for adapted technologies are likely to introduce new jobs to the market and stimulate innovation (Randall 2017). Further, as this regulation impacts citizens of the EU, other nations such as the United States and China have the opportunity to learn from the GDPR successes and failures as they embark upon finding the right balance between internet privacy and profitability.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <h3>Hindering Emerging Technology</h3>
        <p>Opponents of the GDPR argue the very nature of the regulations could suppress new advances in emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), medical research, and Blockchain (Randall 2017). One aim of the GDPR was to discourage an organization from making decisions or generalizations about an individual or group of individuals based on the data collected about them. In the case of AI, for example, it's challenging to justify or explain the logic of algorithms (Wallace 2017). While it is possible to remove bias from the decision-making process in support of the GDPR, it's far more difficult to derive meaning from the data driving those decisions (Wallace 2017). Securing and ensuring privacy for the information associated with Blockchain technology, on the other hand, will be a challenge in and of itself, as a primary purpose for the technology is an open, transparent view of various transactions (Gorey 2018).</p>
        <h3>Increased Technology Costs to Comply</h3>
        <p>Many organizations expect a significant increase in their technology budgets to achieve compliance with the GDPR changes. Several Fortune 500 companies reported allocating upwards towards $1 million to the technology budget, with about half of the amount necessary for additional staffing (Bloomberg 2018). Many firms, such as Google and Facebook, have been working for several years to bring their existing products and services into compliance with the GDPR changes (Brandom 2018). Smaller firms are finding they don't have the financial resources to implement the far-reaching changes which would be necessary to achieve compliance (Kottasová 2018).</p>
        <h3>Stifling Competition</h3>
        <p>Some critics believe the new regulation will stifle competition, favoring larger firms who have sufficient funding and resources to hire great legal teams, security professionals, and programmers; smaller firms, critics argue, will struggle to protect themselves from potential fines (Kottasová 2018). Other organizations have gone so far as to cease all European operations and block consumers from the EU (Giles 2018). Despite argument from the GDPR the fines are scalable based on the size of the organization, the organization has failed to factor in the impact on smaller firms now required to change stable infrastructure, data collection and storage practices, and hire additional staff to field consumer inquiries (Kottasová 2018).</p>

    <div class="subHead">
        <h2>Opportunities</h2>
        <h3>Stimulate Innovation</h3>
        <p>The GDPR is effectively an overhaul of how organizations collect, store, and transport customer data (Gorey 2018). To achieve compliance while maintaining a competitive edge, an organization must find a way to remain innovative despite the change in rules. A primary principle outlined within the GDPR is the concept of “privacy by design” which is a practice where appropriate measures to secure a consumer’s data are built into the product or service, rather than added on as an afterthought (Randall 2017). By taking a more focused approach to design and development up front, teams can be flexible to allow for future changes to the GDPR and balance the need to keep up with consumer demands (Randall 2017).</p>
        <h3>Introduction of New Jobs</h3>
        <p>The GDPR is expected to generate new jobs; already several Fortune 500 companies have allocated upward towards $500,000 for the new internal staff it will require to support the GDPR changes (Bloomberg 2018). Some of these roles will be directly related to the new regulation, such as the required Data Protection Officer (DPO) (Randall 2017). Other jobs will be indirectly related and rise out of the regulation organically. Some examples would be specialists to help organizations navigate the GDPR changes and product, security, or innovation-related roles.</p>
        <h3>Opportunity to Learn from GDPR</h3>
        <p>While some opponents of the regulation are concerned the EU will have too much power to dictate how the United States and other nations structure their data security regulations, the rest of the world has an opportunity to learn from the EU’s model before formally structuring their own (Giles 2018). The world will watch as the EU settles into the regulatory role of enforcer for the GDPR's policies; further, the high fines for non-compliance will place the organization, and all of its decisions, under a high degree of scrutiny (Scott 2018).</p>
        <p>Before seeking to implement policies of their own, the world can observe how the EU will fare in a court of law against some of the world’s largest tech companies such as Google and Facebook (Scott 2018). The GDPR served both companies with lawsuits following the launch of GDPR policy, Facebook for $3.9 billion and Google in the amount of $3.7 billion (Brandom 2018).</p>
